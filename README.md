# Parks and Recreation Character Classifier
Created by Alexis E. for CS131 (Computer Vision), Fall 2022

Summary: Using a PyTorch-based neural network, I was able to hand-train and classify, with up to 71% accuracy, many characters from the hit NBC show, Parks and Recreation.

This repo contains my work for the final project/demo day for CS131. It does not contain all of the training images I have used as that takes up a *lot* of storage. The notebook, however, is fully operational and you will be able to see my model at work there!
